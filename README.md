# Tea Time with Torsten
_A calming sensory ritual for connection and exploration_

**Step 1: The Water**  
"Torsten, let’s listen for the bubble music."  
_Wait for the soft hum of the kettle._  
"Do you hear it waking up? That means the water is getting ready."  

**Step 2: The Teapot**  
"Let’s open the glass pot like a treasure chest."  
_Remove lid together and hold it to his nose._  
"This is the tea. Can you smell it? What does it remind you of?"  

**Step 3: The Pour**  
"Watch closely—here comes the waterfall."  
_Pour hot water slowly into the teapot._  
"See the tea dance? It’s painting the water."  

**Step 4: The Wait**  
"Now we wait. One minute... then two...  
Just like we wait for toast, or traffic lights to turn green."  
_Optional: use a sand timer or visual timer._  

**Step 5: The Watch**  
"Can you see the color changing?"  
"It started like clear glass, now it’s turning golden—or maybe like honey?"  

**Step 6: The Sip**  
_Pour into small clear cups or a favorite mug._  
"Smell it again. Is it different now?"  
"Let’s try a tiny sip together—one, two, three."

**Closing**  
"Thank you, tea. Thank you, Torsten. That was lovely."  
_Clean up together if possible._
